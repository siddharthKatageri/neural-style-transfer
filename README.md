# Neural Style Transfer

Implementation of A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style paper by Leon A. Gatys, Alexander S. Ecker,  Matthias Bethge,
where style from one image and content from another image is drawn out to generate an art peice.

## Objective

Neural Style Transfer is one of the most fun techniques in deep learning. As seen below, it merges two images, namely: a "content" image and a "style" image, to create a "generated" image.
